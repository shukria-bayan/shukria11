       <p>Public housing residents may have a new neighbor next year: an urban farm in the air.</p>
        <p> A rooftop next door to the Forest Houses in Morrisania will soon be home to ReBORN FARMS, a greenhouse garden that can grow enough fresh vegetables to feed hundreds of families.</p>
        <p> Founder Henry Obispo hopes ReBorn Farms will increase the health and economic power of Bronx residents. Besides providing healthy food for the surrounding community, it will also be a place to learn about growing plants and healthy eating.</p>
        <p> Officially known as Arbor House, the building was built on NYCHA land by a private developer. In exchange for favorable prices for the land, the developers pledged to give 25% of the housing units to NYCHA residents, and another 25% to members of the local community.
 
</p>
        <p> “The idea is to grow food centering the people and where the needs are,” Obispo explained in a telephone interview.  He contrasts that with what he describes as a “trickle-down” system of food distribution that currently prevails in the South Bronx.
    </p>
    
        <p>Now, Obispo sees ReBorn farms as the culmination of all those years of work. In February, it was among 14 projects selected by City Fellowship, a six-month mentorship program by the NYC Economic Development Corp. and Company Ventures to support minority entrepreneurs.</p>
        
        <p>According to the analysis by <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2022-09/HRMS%20Food%20Insecurity%20Brief_0.pdf" target="_blank">feeding Americans in 2021,</a> about 1.5 million New Yorkers were experiencing food insecurity. But this number has increased in 2022. Among New York City, the South Bronx district are the most food-insecure area in the city. <a href="https://onemillionhungry.com/" target="_blank">One quarter</a> of residents here do not consume enough nutritious food to live a healthy life. 
        </p>
        
            <p> For the resiliency of food insecurity and food deserts, Community gardens can play their role. Growing food in the community garden provides fresh and healthy food for the resident. </p>

                <p> “We all deserve really fresh food.” said, Liz Dowd the Director of Farming Operations of <a href="https://www.brooklyngrangefarm.com/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Grange,</a> “in terms of solving food insecurity we are just drop in the bucket, but where we do rely on more our farm partners, there we can access to the gardens to learn and engage with the food. That’s definitely have an impact on the healthier lifestyle.”</p>
